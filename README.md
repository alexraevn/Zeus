# Zeus

**ZEUS** is a Python library that serves the weather status and reporting needs of the Cristina Torres Memorial Observatory. The library consists of several scripts that run independently and use the API of the National Weather Service (in the form of Digitial Weather Markup Language, see https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=25.9931&lon=-97.5607&FcstType=digitalDWML) and the API of Sunrise-Sunset (https://sunrise-sunset.org/api). The scripts currently in the Zeus library are:

`status.py` : Report current weather status from the National Weather Service
`forecast.py` : Report the forecasted weather for the next seven days
`bot.py` : Send forecast and status messages to the CTMO Twitter page
